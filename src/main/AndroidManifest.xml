    <!-- You can add <uses-permission> tags here if your library inherently requires certain permissions,
         though it's generally better for the consuming app to declare them.
 
         If your library targets a specific Android version for certain features, you can specify it:
         <uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="21" android:targetSdkVersion="34" />
         However, minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are primarily controlled by build.gradle.kts.
